Note : The complete hadoop ecosystem setup is required to run the files. Read more [here](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)

### Graph Coloring
Determines the minimum required colors for any connected graph dataset.
* GraphColor.java
* GCMessage.java

### Page Rank Algorithm
Determins the page rank of the nodes from the connected graph dataset
* PageRank.java

### Weak Connected Graph
Checks connectivity (weak) of each vertex
* WeakConnect.java
